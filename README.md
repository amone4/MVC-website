# MVC-website
A website based on MVC design pattern

The website searches through various doctors, based on their city and category

The website won't run without its database
Create a database and run `database.sql` to make all the tables required
Fill in app/config/config.php with constants to initialize the website

It also has user related features:
	Register
	Login
	Logout
	Forgot Password
	Change Password
	Email Confirmation

The website can be interfaced with an OTP service
The service that I used for testing, requires an API key
The OTP related code has not been removed
